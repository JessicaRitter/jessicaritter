<h1>Learning Swift with Treehouse's Fun Fact App</h1>
<p>I highly recommend TreeHouse if you want a little hand holding upon diving into a new language.
Their video tutorials are really accessible, start from scratch, and help quickly build up skills.
This is the app that they have you build for their beginning swift program. I was preparing to make my own app and wanted just a quick easy walkthrough of making a swift app.
